# server-side
Temporary repo for server-side PHP code related to MapTool

# Organization
So far, this repo will be used only for MapTool-related server-side code.  That means all code associated
with the following subdomains of rptools.net:
* services (used for registering new servers and finding out which servers are available)

The goal is to add new subdomains as new functionality is needed for MapTool.  For example:
* registry (where MT sends information about new servers started with a name)
* updates (where MT checks to see whether a newer version is available)
* stacktraces (where MT uploads stack traces generated by Java exception handling)
